# 🧮 Simple Python Console Calculator

A basic command-line calculator built with Python. This project serves as a foundational example for using Python for simple applications and demonstrates best practices for project structure, version control (Git/GitHub), and documentation.

## ✨ Features

* **Four Basic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) of two numbers.
* **Simple Command Line Interface (CLI):** Easy-to-use text-based interface.
* **Error Handling:** Prevents crashing on common errors like division by zero or invalid input.
* **Modular Code:** Operations are separated into distinct functions for clean, readable code.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator.git](https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator.git)
    cd python-calculator
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    This project has no external dependencies, but if you were to add complex features (like a GUI or a parser), you would use this step:
    ```bash
    # pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```

## 💻 Usage

To run the calculator, execute the main Python file.

```bash
python main.py
